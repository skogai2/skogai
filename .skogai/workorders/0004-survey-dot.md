# Goal

Write a survey of the skogai2 repo **dot** (local clone: `/home/skogix/dot`) so the orchestrator can plan how to work in it. This is a read-only survey.

# Scope

- Read anything under `/home/skogix/dot`. Use the Read/Glob/Grep tools for files, and `git -C /home/skogix/dot ...` for history and status.
- **Do not modify `/home/skogix/dot` in any way.** That means no edits, commits, fetches, checkouts or stashes.
- Your only output is the `## Report` section of this workorder file, in this skogai worktree.
- Out of scope: any fixes or suggestions you would implement yourself. List them as findings instead.

# Done when

The report answers each question below under its own `###` heading. Keep it concise, and cite file paths for your claims. Say "unknown" rather than guessing.

1. **Purpose and status.** What is this repo for, in two or three sentences? Is it active, work-in-progress, a seed/skeleton, or abandoned? Give evidence: recent commits, TODOs, empty directories.
2. **Layout.** Key directories and files, and the entry-point docs (README, SKOGAI.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, `.skogai/`, `.claude/`).
3. **Agent conventions.** Routing files, `@`-includes, skills, hooks, Claude settings, plugins, knowledge bundles (OKF or other), memory files. How does an agent working here get oriented?
4. **Toolchain.** Languages, package managers, mise or argc, and the exact build, test and lint commands (or "none"). CI setup.
5. **Git state.** Default branch, other branches, submodules, worktrees, remotes, uncommitted or unpushed work (from `git status` and `git log @{u}..`), and the recent commit themes.
6. **Relationships.** References to other skogai2 repos (skogai, claude, config, dot, skogix, marketplace, dash-skogai, skogai-cli, skogai-docs, skogai-fleet, skogai-git-workflow, skogai-routing, okn, open-knowledge-plugin) or to paths under `~`. Is it installed or symlinked anywhere live (`~/.config`, `~/.claude`, plugin installs)?
7. **Orchestration readiness.** Could a worker safely work in a `wt` worktree of this repo? What would break, for example absolute paths, live-installed config, symlinks or secrets? What would a workorder for this repo need to tell the worker?
8. **Open questions for skogix.** Oddities, contradictions, or decisions that seem to be missing.

# Context

- The orchestration model is described in `.skogai/knowledge/decisions/0002-orchestration-model.md` (in this worktree).
- The tools available on this machine are listed in `TOOLS.md`.
