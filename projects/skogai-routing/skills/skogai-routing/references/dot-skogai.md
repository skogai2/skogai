<name_explanation>

**dot-skogai** is the file-safe name for `.skogai`

the dot comes from the convention of using a leading period to denote hidden or configuration directories. this signifies that `.skogai` is a special folder within the SkogAI ecosystem, often used for storing the base configuration and settings.

originally this was `$HOME/.skogai` and the only real folder in the SkogaAI system, shortly joined by `$HOME/.<agent-name>` folder which had agent specific information (dot, and thus `$HOME/.dot`) being the first agent - named from the dotfile convention itself among other things).

now today the `SkogAI/.skogai` repository serves as both "the base configuration" as well as "add as a submodule to your own projects" folder - making .skogai a folder for both system wide settings as well as a way to quickly setup new projects by using the .skogai-submodule as a bootstrap for everything SkogAI.
